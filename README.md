# TransMark
TransMark is a dynamic web application designed to enhance the way users interact with transcripts by allowing them to add, manage, and organize comments efficiently. With TransMark, users can easily annotate specific points in a transcript, attach relevant files, and view a summarized list of all comments for quick reference.

# Key Features:
Comment on Specific Transcript Points: Users can seamlessly add comments at precise moments in the transcript, making it easier to reference and discuss specific content.

Comment Summary View: A dedicated summary view compiles all the comments in one place, allowing for quick navigation and review of the entire discussion.

Attach Files to Comments: Going beyond text, users can attach files such as PDFs, images, or links to their comments, providing additional context or resources related to the transcript.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, TransMark offers an intuitive interface that ensures users can focus on the content without unnecessary distractions.

Efficient Data Management: Backed by a robust backend, TransMark manages transcript data and associated comments, ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
